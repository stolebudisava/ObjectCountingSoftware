# ObjectCountingSoftware

This was software that i build during studing on 
Faculty of technical sciences and my batchelor degree title - Software for classification of objects on coveyour belt.
It uses OpenCV libraries for identification and classification of moving different objects by their color, counting different objects which went
on conveyour belt and counting them. Software also shoots video of all proccess automatically or manually and creates a log file
which contains in what periods of time object have passed on coneyour belt.
