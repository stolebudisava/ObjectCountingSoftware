# ObjectCountingSoftware

PokretnaTraka is software i've created during studying on 
Faculty of technical sciences for my bachelor degree title - Software for classification of objects on coveyour belt.
Written in C++, it uses OpenCV libraries for identification and classification of moving different objects by their color, counting them in current frame of cameras video, also counting all objects that passed in front of camera. Software also shoots video of all proccess automatically or manually and creates a log file
which contains what type of object in what periods of time object have passed on conveyour belt.
