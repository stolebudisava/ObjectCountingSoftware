# ObjectCountingSoftware

PokretnaTraka is software i've created during my studies on
Faculty of technical sciences in Novi Sad
for my bachelor with honours Software for classification of objects on conveyor belt (Softver za klasifikaciju objekata na pokretnoj traci). Written in C++, it uses OpenCV libraries for identification and classification of different moving objects by their color, counting them in current frame of video. Software creates video of all process (objects marked using augmented reality) automatically or manually (user defines it) and creates a log file which contains what type of object in what period of time have passed on conveyor belt.
